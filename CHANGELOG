1.0.4-SNAPSHOT, released on 1-11-2015

* Added a third scaling mode: "Wurm Unlimited Scaled", which multiplies vertical heights by four in the export, so that the proportions look right in WorldPainter (but the heights reported in WorldPainter are a quarter of what they will be in Wurm Unlimited). The scaling mode parameters are now:
  --minecraft (Minecraft mode: horizontal scale 4:1, vertical scale: 1:1; this is the default)
  --wurmUnscaled (Wurm Unlimited Unscaled mode: horizontal scale 1:1, vertical scale 1:1; slopes will be exaggerated in WorldPainter)
  --wurmScaled (Wurm Unlimited Scaled mode: horizontal scale 1:1, vertical scale 1:4; slopes will look correct in WorldPainter but reported heights will be incorrect)
* Increased minimum depth for kelp so there's less chance of it breaching the surface of the water
* More accurate alignment of terrain types to heights

1.0.3-SNAPSHOT, released on 31-10-2015

* Trees are only placed on grass, dirt, marsh or moss tiles
* The amount of moss has been halved
* The Beaches terrain type will generate patches of reed along the waterline, as well as patches of kelp underwater
* The Grass terrain type will generate patches of kelp underwater
* Steep rock (at a higher angle than 45 degrees) will be turned to cliff

1.0.2-SNAPSHOT, released on 25-10-2015

* Added an unscaled horizontal scaling mode which translates blocks to tiles 1:1. Add the parameter --unscaled on the command line to select it

1.0.1-SNAPSHOT, released on 25-10-2015

* The different tree layers now place different types of tree:
  + Deciduous places birch, oak, maple, chestnut and linden trees
  + Pine places cedars, pines and firs
  + Swamp land places willows and changes grass and dirt tiles around the water level to marsh
  + Jungle places apple, lemon, olive, cherry and walnut trees
  + All tree layers also place bushes of every type
* Map podzol to peat and soul sand to tar
* Grass (but not bare grass) will now have random patches of moss, as will forests (except swamp land)
* Any unsupported materials and layers encountered are now reported as a warning
* Bug fix: account for tile size difference when calculating WU map size
