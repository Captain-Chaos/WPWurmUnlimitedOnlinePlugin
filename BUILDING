This is a straightforward Maven project. Make sure you have Java 8 and Maven 3
installed and build the distributable by invoking:

mvn install

The only wrinkle is that it depends on the Wurm Unlimited API, which doesn't
exist in Maven central. You'll have to download the API from
https://github.com/codeclubab/WurmModServerApi and then install common.jar from
the lib directory in your local Maven repo as
com.wurmonline.common:WurmOnlineCommon:1.0.0, and build and install the API itself as
com.wurmonline.api:WurmOnlineAPI:1.0.0.
